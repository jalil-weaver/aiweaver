# Observed Issues

### **Structural problems**

- No formal start gate for an estimation
- No formal end gate for an estimation
- Estimation can start with incomplete or ambiguous inputs
- No single canonical input document required to estimate
- No separation between feasibility checks and effort estimation
- No predefined estimation scenarios (speed vs cost vs risk)
- No explicit ownership of estimation closure
- No explicit link between estimation and capacity confirmation
- Estimation outcome not explicitly frozen or versioned

---

### **Symptoms**

- Estimation triggered informally (message in Discord)
- Brief quality varies from project to project
- Open questions discovered during estimation instead of before
- Significant time spent on feasibility research during estimation
- Assumptions made implicitly (API vs scraping)
- External tool constraints discovered late
- Estimation duration unpredictable
- Founder or Director intervention required after estimation
- Sales receives a document but no explicit “estimation closed” signal
- No shared understanding of what is assumed vs confirmed
- Estimation stops implicitly, not explicitly

---

### **SPOF**

- Single technical person researching feasibility under time pressure
- Estimation quality depends on personal experience and intuition
- Founder required to re-contextualize estimation after delivery
- External tools (APIs, third-party services) as hidden blockers
- Informal communication tools (Discord) as trigger and closure channel

---

### **Boundaries (current, implicit)**

**Estimation start**

- Estimation starts when Jalil shares documents and asks “please estimate”

**Estimation end**

- Estimation ends when a document is sent to sales
- No explicit confirmation that estimation is closed
- No rule preventing late changes or reinterpretation

---

### **Meta-issue (core)**

- The system allows **estimation to absorb uncertainty** instead of rejecting it
- Estimation mixes:
    - feasibility discovery
    - scope clarification
    - effort calculation
- Capacity is discussed **after** estimation instead of being a prerequisite
- The system relies on people to compensate for missing structure
