# Observed issues

### Structural problems

- No formal Framing start point
- No formal Framing end point
- No clear unit of work or milestones defining the Framing
- No single source of truth for project information
- No explicit ownership of the Framing lifecycle as a system

---

### Symptoms

- No structured project information gathering before PM involvement
- PM discovers project context live during sessions
- Onboarding call has no defined agenda or expected outputs
- No milestones shared with the client
- Client sessions are not standardized
- Designer briefing has no fixed template
- Multiple back-and-forth loops without clear validation checkpoints
- No tracking of design execution status
- Deadlines are implicit or not communicated
- Information scattered across WhatsApp, Google Docs, Discord, Figma
- Decisions and validations happen orally or via chat
- No explicit Framing closure
- No final recap / handoff document at the end of the Framing

---

### SPOF

- PM as the single cognitive center of the Framing (context, decisions, continuity)
- WhatsApp as the main operational and decision channel
- Implicit start/end of the Framing preventing measurement, replication, and scaling

---

### Boundaries

**Framing start**

- *The Framing starts when the signed client information is manually sent to the CS, who initiates the onboarding.*
- *The Framing is considered started when the first session with the PM takes place.*

**Framing end**

- *Nothing explicitly triggers the end of the Framing.*
- *The Framing is considered ended when the design and documentation are implicitly validated by the client.*
