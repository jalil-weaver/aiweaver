# SPOF’s

## **Capacity & Load**

- Evolution depends on a single developer carrying execution, design, and decisions
- No explicit capacity model for Evolution work
- Developer load fluctuates based on unqualified client requests
- No protection against cumulative overload over time
- Capacity implicitly renegotiated through pressure instead of system rules
- Developer continuity is critical but not structurally secured

---

## **Product Ownership & Prioritization**

- No formal product owner on the client side
- Client does not know how to prioritize or sequence requests
- Feature requests arrive continuously without qualification
- Bugs, improvements, and new features are mixed together
- No objective rule to decide what should be worked on next
- Evolution treated as “do whatever seems important now”

---

## **Visibility & Progress Perception**

- No unit of progress visible to the client
- Progress perceived through feelings, not facts
- Client does not consult tracking or documentation tools
- Sync meetings are irregular or skipped
- No cadence creating a sense of advancement
- Silence or async work interpreted as inactivity

---

## **Scope & Change Management**

- Scope evolves continuously without explicit system move
- Changes invalidate previous work without consequence
- No cost attached to change of direction
- No distinction between iteration and rework
- Evolution becomes an infinite scope surface
- Developer absorbs instability instead of the system

---

## **Communication & Decision Flow**

- Informal channels used for feature and bug requests
- Decisions made reactively under client pressure
- No single authoritative input channel
- Founder pulled into client conversations as reassurance
- Developer exposed directly to client anxiety
- No rule defining when execution must stop or slow down

---

## **Design & Specification Drift**

- Features requested without prior design or framing
- Developer forced to make UX and product decisions
- No validation of design intent before build
- Product consistency degrades over time
- Quality depends on individual judgment, not system rules

---

## **Client Expectation & Trust**

- Cost reduction increases scrutiny instead of confidence
- Client correlates price with perceived effort
- Value delivered is not legible or contextualized
- Client distrusts progress despite acknowledging quality
- Threat of churn used as escalation mechanism

---

## **Exit & Requalification**

- No explicit pause or stop state for Evolution
- No mechanism to requalify work into Delivery or Maintenance
- Evolution continues until budget cut or conflict
- Transition to Maintenance used as escape, not decision
- No formal closure of an Evolution cycle

---

## **Meta-SPOF (most dangerous)**

- Evolution is treated as availability, not as a system
- Anxiety is managed by people instead of rules
- Trust relies on individuals, not structure
- Developer burnout risk is structural, not incidental
- System has no way to say “no” without human conflict
