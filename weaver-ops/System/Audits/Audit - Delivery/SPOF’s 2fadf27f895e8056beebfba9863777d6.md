# SPOF’s

## Capacity & Staffing

- Delivery start depends on one person confirming capacity
- External developers negotiated case by case
- Key dev unavailable or drops mid-project
- Onboarding of dev happens after planning started
- Partial team starts execution
- Capacity assumptions made before commitment

---

## Inputs & References

- Missing or incomplete delivery documentation
- Designs received but not production-ready
- Multiple sources of truth for scope (doc, Figma, messages)
- Late discovery of undocumented requirements
- Client assets or credentials delivered progressively
- Reference inputs change without explicit system move

---

## Technical Risk

- API limitations discovered after build started
- Third-party dependency unstable or undocumented
- Infra constraints identified too late
- No early feasibility check for critical integrations
- Environment differences between test and prod
- No rollback strategy defined upfront

---

## Infrastructure & Access

- Delay in domain access or DNS control
- Missing server access or cloud permissions
- API keys delivered late or invalid
- Secrets handled manually by individuals
- Infra owned by client with slow response times

---

## Ownership & Decision

- PM as single point for all delivery decisions
- Tech lead implicitly arbitrating scope vs quality
- Founder pulled in to resolve delivery blockers
- No explicit rule to stop execution when blocked
- Decisions made orally or in chat under pressure

---

## Timeline & Commitment

- Delivery timeline starts before readiness
- Preparation time hidden inside execution
- Client expects progress during staffing/setup
- No explicit pause state when blocked
- Slippage attributed to execution instead of readiness

---

## Validation & Closure

- “Almost done” treated as done
- Acceptance criteria implicit or subjective
- Bugs reclassified as improvements
- Client feedback reopening closed scope
- Final payment blocking handoff
- No formal closure separating Delivery from Evolution

---

## Meta-SPOF (most dangerous)

- System allows execution to start without being truly ready
- Pressure handled by people instead of rules
- Exceptions tolerated without explicit system cost
