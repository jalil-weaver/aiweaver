# Audit - Estimation & Capacity

**1. Context**

- **Client name:** Dalila
- **Project name:** For’expert
- **Date:** 23 December 2024
- **People involved:** 3 (Irfan, Megandi, Jalil)
- **Capacity (Number of Developer)**: 1

**2. Trigger**

- **What triggered the start of the estimation?** Jalil send the documents to the Discord channel
- **Who initiated it?** Jalil
- **Tool used:** Discord

**3. Chronological Steps (Actual sequence)**

**Step 1**

- **Action performed:** Sent project brief (Project_Dalila_to_estimate.pdf) and asked the group to

start estimation.

- **Performed by:** Jalil
- **Tool:** Discord
- **Output generated:** Brief available in the channel; estimation request visible to the team.

**Step 2**

- **Action performed:** Read the brief, listed open questions (APIs, templates, volume, SLA), and

researched integration feasibility for Pennylane, Aptelec, and Tactileo (API vs scraping) before

drafting scope and effort assumptions.

- **Performed by:** Irfan
- **Tool:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Google Docs; Pennylane API, Aptelec, Tactileo (docs / feasibility check)
- **Output generated:** Document with scope summary, list of questions to resolve before dev, and

integration assumptions (API vs fallback) used for the estimate.

**Step 3**

- **Action performed:** Discussed context and cost expectations.
- **Performed by:** Megandi
- **Tool:** Call / Meeting
- **Output generated:** Aligned assumptions (e.g. “weeks not months”, automation only) and direction

for the estimate.

**Step 4**

- **Action performed:** Shared the estimation doc to Jalil.
- **Performed by:** Irfan / Megandi- **Tool:** Google Docs (link) / Discord, Notion or email
- **Output generated:** Final deliverable: “Google Doc with timeline and cost”, delivery date 29

December 2025.

**4. Blockers & Frictions**

- **What slowed down the process?** Checking external tools (Pennylane API, Aptelec, Tactileo) for

integration feasibility → time spent on research before committing to numbers.

- **Where exactly did it block?** In step 2
- **Why did it happen?** The brief listed integration with Pennylane, Aptelec, and Tactileo as

requirements but did not confirm whether APIs exist or are available; the estimate had to assume

“API vs scraping” and research each tool before committing to effort. No single source of truth (e.g.

client confirmation or vendor docs) was available before estimation, so Irfan had to spend time

checking feasibility instead of using pre-validated answers.

**5. Founder Intervention**

- **Did the Director (Megandi) intervene?** Yes
- **When?** a day after Irfan finished the estimate
- **Why?** to know the context and estimate the cost

**6. Final Deliverables**

- **What was delivered to the sales team?** Google docs that fill information of timeline and cost
- **Format:** Google Docs
- **Delivery date:** 29 December 2025

**7. Project Closure**

- **What marked the end of the estimation?** The timeline/cost Google Doc was sent to the sales

team on 29 December 2025; no one asked for changes or said “estimation closed.

- **Was it explicit or implicit?** here was no clear “we’re done” message; the process just stopped

after delivery.
