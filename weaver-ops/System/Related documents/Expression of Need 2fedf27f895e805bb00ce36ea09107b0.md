# Expression of Need

## **Purpose**

Capture the client need in a clear, structured, and non-executable way, to serve as the starting point for Framing.

---

## **1. Primary Target**

- Who is the main target user of the product
- Role, profile, or type of organization
- Why this target is the priority

Only one primary target.

---

## **2. Key Pain Points**

List **exactly three pain points**, ordered from most critical to least critical.

For each pain point:

- Description of the problem
- Impact on the target
- **Solution envisioned by the client** (high-level, non-technical)

No features. No implementation details.

---

## **3. Context**

- Business or operational context
- Why this need exists now
- Triggers or constraints influencing the project

---

## **4. Objectives**

- What the client wants to achieve
- Expected outcomes if the problem is solved
- Non-functional expectations (speed, reliability, simplicity, etc.)

---

## **5. Constraints**

- Time constraints
- Budget constraints
- Legal, regulatory, or organizational constraints
- Any non-negotiable elements

---

## **6. Success Criteria**

- How success will be measured
- What must be true for the project to be considered successful

These criteria will be used later to validate scope decisions.

---

## **7. Existing Materials (if any)**

- Links to existing documentation
- Links to mockups, designs, specs, references
- Explicit mention if nothing exists yet

---

## **Rules**

- This document does not define the final scope
- This document does not define features or technical solutions
- This document expresses intent, not execution

---

## **Outcome**

At validation:

- The target is clearly identified
- The top problems and expected solutions are explicit
- Framing can start without ambiguity
