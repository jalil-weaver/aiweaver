# Change Specification

## **Purpose**

Describe **exactly what changes** compared to the existing product, so Estimation and Development can act **without reinterpretation**.

---

## **Scope of change**

- What is changing
- What is added, modified, or removed
- What explicitly stays unchanged

---

## **Business context**

- Why this change is needed
- Which problem it solves
- Priority level (high / medium / low)

---

## **Functional changes**

- List of new or modified behaviors
- Written in clear, testable statements
- Reference existing functionality when impacted

(If relevant, Gherkin allowed but not mandatory)

---

## **Impact analysis**

- Affected features or modules
- Dependencies with existing logic
- Backward compatibility concerns (if any)

---

## **UX / Design impact**

- Does this change impact user flows, screens, or interactions?
    - Yes → design update required
    - No → no design required
- If yes: link to updated screens / prototype

---

## **Constraints**

- Technical constraints
- Time constraints
- Non-negotiable assumptions

---

## **Acceptance**

- Change clearly understood
- Change validated internally
- Change ready for estimation

---

## **Outcome**

- Estimation is based on **delta only**
- No re-analysis of the full product
- No ambiguity during Development
