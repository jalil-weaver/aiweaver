# Infrastructure Change Brief

## **Purpose**

Describe an **infrastructure problem or limitation** so DevOps can analyze, design the appropriate changes, and estimate impact **without being biased by a predefined solution**.

---

## **Context**

- Client name
- Project or product concerned
- Current phase
    - Development
    - Maintenance
    - Tech-as-a-Service
- Related delivery or contract (if applicable)

---

## **Current Situation**

Describe **what is happening today**.

- Existing infrastructure overview (high level)
- What is not working or becoming a problem
- Since when the issue exists
- Frequency or severity (if relevant)

Examples:

- Performance degradation under load
- Deployment becoming unreliable
- Costs increasing unexpectedly
- Security or compliance concerns

---

## **Objective of the Change**

Describe **what must be achieved**, not how.

- Scale to support X users
- Improve reliability or uptime
- Reduce infrastructure costs
- Improve security or compliance
- Enable a new technical capability

---

## **Constraints**

List any non-negotiable constraints.

- Downtime allowed or not
- Budget sensitivity (low / medium / high)
- Deadline or timing constraint
- Provider or technology constraints (if any)

---

## **Related Changes**

If applicable:

- New features impacting infrastructure
- Traffic or usage growth
- External dependencies changes
- Regulatory or compliance requirements

---

## **Access & Readiness**

- DevOps has access to:
    - Infrastructure accounts
    - Monitoring / logs (if any)
    - Codebase or deployment pipelines (if relevant)

---

## **Acceptance**

- Brief reviewed and validated
- Problem and objectives clearly understood
- No solution imposed
- Ready for infrastructure analysis and estimation

---

## **Outcome**

- DevOps can:
    - Propose one or more infrastructure approaches
    - Estimate effort, risks, and infra cost impact
    - Support a go / no-go or pricing decision
