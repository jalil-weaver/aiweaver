# Product Roadmap

## **Purpose**

Describe the planned product evolution over multiple months so continuous delivery can be organized without ambiguity.

---

## **Content**

### **Roadmap horizon**

- Time horizon covered (minimum 3 months)
- Roadmap is **rolling and evolutive**
- No fixed deadlines, only ordering and intent

---

### **Initiatives / Themes**

- High-level initiatives or product themes
- Each initiative represents a coherent business or product objective
- Initiatives are ordered by priority, not by date

Example:

- Improve onboarding conversion
- Stabilize payment system
- Enable team management features

---

### **Planned capabilities**

For each initiative:

- List of capabilities or outcomes to reach
- Written in **intent form**, not solution form
- No technical or UX implementation details

Example:

- Users can recover access to their account
- Admins can manage user permissions
- Payments can be retried automatically

---

### **Dependencies and constraints**

- Known dependencies between initiatives
- External constraints impacting sequencing
- Explicit risks or unknowns

---

### **Evolution rules**

- How new initiatives are added
- How priorities can change
- Who can trigger roadmap changes

---

## **Exclusions**

- No feature-level specification
- No sprint or milestone planning
- No delivery commitment
- No design or technical solution

---

## **Outcome**

- The product direction is explicit over several months
- The roadmap can be translated into a backlog
- Continuous delivery can start and evolve without re-framing the product
- Changes can be absorbed without breaking the system
