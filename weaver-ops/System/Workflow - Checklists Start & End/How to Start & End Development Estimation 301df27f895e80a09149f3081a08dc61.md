# How to Start & End Development Estimation

### Input Qualification (General)

- ☐ At least **one** valid input option (A, B, or C) is clearly identified (Yes / No)
- ☐ No assumption is required to understand the inputs (Yes / No)

---

### Option A – Full Product Scope

- ☐ Product documentation exists (Yes / No)
- ☐ Product documentation is readable and complete (Yes / No)
- ☐ Design exists (Yes / No)
- ☐ Design is validated (explicit validation recorded) (Yes / No)
- ☐ Delivery scenario **or** Product Roadmap exists (Yes / No)

---

### Option B – Product Change

- ☐ Change specification exists (Yes / No)
- ☐ Change specification is explicit and unambiguous (Yes / No)
- ☐ Design is updated if impacted by the change (Yes / No)

---

### Option C – Infrastructure Change

- ☐ Infrastructure Change Brief exists (Yes / No)
- ☐ Infrastructure Change Brief is readable and complete (Yes / No)

---

### Estimation Safety

- ☐ All required documents are accessible to the estimation team (Yes / No)
- ☐ Missing inputs (if any) are explicitly identified (Yes / No)

---

# **How to End – Workflow: Development Estimation**

### Scenario Production

- ☐ At least one development delivery scenario exists (Yes / No)
- ☐ Each delivery scenario is executable (no assumption required) (Yes / No)
- ☐ Infrastructure impact is included when relevant (Yes / No)
- ☐ IA impact is included when relevant (Yes / No)

---

### Estimation Integrity

- ☐ Scenarios are consolidated into a single usable output (Yes / No)
- ☐ Estimation does **not** include pricing (Yes / No)
- ☐ Estimation does **not** include assumptions (Yes / No)

---

### Alternative Valid Exit (Blocking Case)

- ☐ Estimation is explicitly blocked due to missing inputs (Yes / No)
- ☐ Missing inputs are documented clearly and explicitly (Yes / No)
- ☐ No estimation output is produced in case of blocking (Yes / No)

Checklist

### **State 0 – Estimation Readiness Check**

☐ Required inputs (Option A, B, or C) are reviewed and assessed

☐ Inputs are explicitly classified as sufficient or insufficient

☐ If insufficient, missing inputs are clearly documented

☐ Estimation is either authorized to start or explicitly blocked

---

### **State 1 – Scenario Construction**

☐ At least one executable delivery scenario is defined (roles, staffing, duration, risks)

☐ Delivery duration complies with the 15-week rule (or an adjusted scenario exists)

☐ Infrastructure requirements and risks are integrated when applicable

☐ AI-related assumptions and constraints are integrated when applicable

---

### **State 2 – Estimation Consolidation**

☐ Delivery scenarios are internally coherent and executable

☐ Estimation output contains no assumptions, pricing, or internal costs

☐ Finalized delivery scenarios are shared with Sales in a usable format
