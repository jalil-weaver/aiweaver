# **How to End Framing Change**

### Change Scope Lock

- ☐ Change scope is explicitly defined as a **delta** from the existing product (Yes / No)
- ☐ Added elements are explicitly listed (Yes / No)
- ☐ Modified elements are explicitly listed (Yes / No)
- ☐ Removed elements are explicitly listed (Yes / No)

---

---

### Design Impact

---

### Handover Readiness

Checklist

### **State 0 – Change Qualification & Lock**

☐ Change request is documented and traceable

☐ Change is clearly classified as accepted, rejected, or redirected

---

### **State 1 – Change Scope Definition**

☐ Functional delta (added / modified / removed) is explicitly defined

☐ Non-impacted scope is explicitly stated

☐ Design impact is clearly decided (required or not)

---

### **State 2 – Technical Decision Gate**

☐ Technical impact of the change is analyzed and documented

☐ Execution implications are clear

☐ Infrastructure impact is classified (none / potential / confirmed)

---

### **State 3 – Change Lock & Handover**

☐ Change Specification is validated and locked

☐ Change is routed to the correct estimation flow
