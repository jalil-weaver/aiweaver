# Action guide

An action represents **a single step that moves work forward**.

### **Rules**

- Has one objective only
- Produces a visible result
- Belongs to one state only
- Describes what must be true after, not how

### **How to create actions**

- Split actions if they produce multiple results
- Never mix decision and execution in the same action
- If an action fails, the state cannot be closed

> If it does more than one thing, it is not one action.
