# Daily ops guide

Daily operations represent **continuous operational activity**.

### **Rules**

- Have no defined beginning or end
- Are executed repeatedly over time
- Support workflows without belonging to them
- Never produce delivery decisions

### **How to use daily operations**

- Keep them outside workflows
- Reference them when needed
- Optimize them without changing delivery logic

> If it never really starts or ends, it is a daily operation.
