# Related documents guide

Related documents represent **shared sources of truth**.

### **Rules**

- Can be used by any workflow, state, action, or work
- Are not owned by a single workflow
- Live in one shared document library
- Can be inputs, outputs, or references

### **How to manage documents**

- If a document is useful in multiple places, it is shared
- If a document is not in the library, it does not exist
- Documents make work explicit, not implicit

> Documents do not drive decisions. They support them.
