# Workflow guide

### **Rules**

- Has a clear start and a clear end
- Produces a result delivered to a client
- Structures execution from beginning to end
- Contains states, actions, and references to works

### **How to create or modify a workflow**

- Create a workflow only if it represents a real deliverable
- Do not create workflows for internal effort only
- If execution feels unclear or chaotic, adjust the workflow
- Keep workflows few and stable

> If it is not deliverable, it is not a workflow.
