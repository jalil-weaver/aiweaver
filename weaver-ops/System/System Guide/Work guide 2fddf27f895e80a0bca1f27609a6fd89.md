# Work guide

A work represents **bounded execution**.

### **Rules**

- Has a clear beginning and a clear end
- Produces information, documents, or execution outputs
- Takes no decisions
- Does not validate or block anything

### **How to use works**

- Works are triggered by actions
- Works feed decisions but never take them
- Works can be measured and improved independently

> If it decides, it is not a work.
