# Workflow - Framing & Design

## **Purpose**

Transform a client need into a clear and agreed scope, through product documentation, technical documentation, and an animated prototype.

## **States**

---

[**State 0 - Need Clarification & Scope Intent Lock**](Workflow%20-%20Framing%20&%20Design/State%200%20-%20Need%20Clarification%20&%20Scope%20Intent%20Lock%202fedf27f895e808fb70ffba740061ea3.md)

Clarify the client need, lock the direction, and secure an explicit early commitment before detailed work starts.

---

[**State 1 - Product Definition**](Workflow%20-%20Framing%20&%20Design/State%201%20-%20Product%20Definition%202fedf27f895e805ba417c95dadadb2c7.md)

Define what will be built and lock the functional scope.

---

[**State 2 - Design Definition**](Workflow%20-%20Framing%20&%20Design/State%202%20-%20Design%20Definition%202fedf27f895e80e1a372c1ab12aa670c.md)

Design the complete user experience through an animated prototype and design system.

---

[**State 3 - Technical Definition**](Workflow%20-%20Framing%20&%20Design/State%203%20-%20Technical%20Definition%202fedf27f895e806f8263cd5c435f2324.md)

Define how the product will be built based on the validated product scope and design.

---

[**State 4 - Delivery Scenarios Definition**](Workflow%20-%20Framing%20&%20Design/State%204%20-%20Delivery%20Scenarios%20Definition%202fedf27f895e80c9a574d791dd6bf726.md)

Produce one or more executable development scenarios aligned with delivery constraints.

---

## **Invariants**

- Scope is locked before technical definition starts
- Design precedes technical documentation
- Delivery scenarios are always produced for internal purpose, never shared with the client
- States are irreversible
