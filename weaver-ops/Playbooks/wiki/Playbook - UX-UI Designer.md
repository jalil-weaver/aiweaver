# Function Playbook – UX/UI Designer

## Mission
Translate validated scope into tangible user journeys, interfaces, and design systems that de-risk delivery. Designers are central during Framing & Design (States 1–2) and remain embedded during Development for design QA.

## Ready-to-Start Checklist
- [ ] Expression of Need + Product Documentation reviewed; scope intent understood.
- [ ] Success metrics and constraints (brand, accessibility, compliance) noted.
- [ ] Design tooling (Figma libraries, prototyping plugins) configured for the project.
- [ ] Collaboration cadence with PPL, Tech Lead, and Developers agreed (design reviews, office hours).
- [ ] Traceability sheet template prepared to map features → screens.

## Operating Rhythm
### Framing Phase
- Produce journeys, wireframes, and user stories iteratively with the PPL.
- Validate designs with stakeholders weekly; capture decisions directly in Figma comments and the design log.
- Maintain the design system (tokens, components, variants) and document usage guidance.

### Delivery Phase
- Run design QA on each completed ticket before it hits QA column.
- Manage design debt backlog and highlight blockers during rituals.
- Update spec files when scope changes (after change workflow approval).

## Execution Guidance
1. **Discovery & Clarification** – run interviews/workshops as needed; document insights succinctly.
2. **Journey Mapping** – cover primary + edge flows, including error/empty/loading states.
3. **Design System Alignment** – reuse existing components first; propose new atoms only with rationale.
4. **Prototype & Validate** – create interactive prototypes covering core flows; collect async feedback.
5. **Handoff Package** – provide annotated specs (measurements, states, behaviors) + assets export guidance.
6. **Design QA** – verify implementation in staging; log deviations clearly (screenshot + expected behavior).

## Collaboration Interfaces
| Partner | Alignment |
| --- | --- |
| Project/Product Lead | Scope prioritization, success metrics, approvals. |
| Tech Lead | Feasibility, performance constraints, responsive behavior. |
| Frontend/Mobile Devs | Component usage, design tokens, QA fixes. |
| QA / Tester | Test cases for UX details (animations, states). |

## Quality & KPIs
- **Design completeness**: 100% of scoped features mapped to screens + traceability sheet.
- **Design debt**: tracked and reviewed weekly; unresolved items < 5% of backlog.
- **Feedback turnaround**: respond to implementation questions within 1 business day.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance by design.

## Guardrails
- No design work proceeds without Scope Intent approval.
- Any change impacting scope requires explicit signoff via Framing Change + documentation updates.
- Keep systemic tokens in sync with Engineering; no local overrides.
- Archive obsolete design files to avoid confusion.

## Handoffs
- Share prototype links + design kit with version tags.
- Provide release visuals/screenshots for comms when requested.
- Update documentation_produit with final design artifacts and motion references.
